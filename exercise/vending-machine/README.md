# Vending Machine (Fullstackdev Internship Challenge)

## About

project assigned by I GEAR GEEK to make vending machine based on their conditions.

I designed the UI based on real vending machine (skeuomorphism?)

Created using `create-react-app`.

## Stack

 - React — Main web app framework
 - Bootstrap — Interface component framework
 - Sass — Extends CSS functionality
 - Git — *Obviously*
 - Heroku — Hosting

I use built in `fetch` for API call.

## Website

You can visit the hosted site [here](https://beam41-internship.herokuapp.com/).

Note: I also host this project on [gh-pages](https://beam41.github.io/fullstackdev-internship-challenge), but it's problably broken and it's not latest. So, please use the former link hosted on Heroku.

## Estimated total time spent

I start this project on 28 Jan 2020 and end on 31 Jan 2020 (Count until deploy deploy).

Tracked by Git commit. (I always commit before stop and go to sleep.)

29 Jan 2020 — 12 AM - 1 AM = 1 hour, 2 PM - 12 AM = 10 hours

30 Jan 2020 — 10 PM - 12 AM = 2 hours
